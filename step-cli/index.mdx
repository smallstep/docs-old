## Introduction to `step`

`step` is an easy-to-use CLI tool for building, operating, and automating Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems and workflows. `step` acts as front-end interface to [`step-ca`](/docs/step-ca), an online X.509 and SSH Certificate Authority (CA). `step` is also a general-purpose PKI toolkit: You can use it to run a minimalist, offline X.509 CA and to perform other basic crypto operations.

## Using `step` with `step-ca`

If you'd like to use `step` with `step-ca`, head over to the [`step-ca` documentation](/docs/step-ca) for command usage information and examples.

## Examples that don't require `step-ca`

`step` has plenty of features that make crypto easier for the casual user.

Here's a few common uses of the `step` command that don't require `step-ca`:

- [Run a stateless, offline X.509 Certificate Authority](/docs/step-cli/basic-crypto-operations#run-an-offline-x509-certificate-authority)
- [Get a TLS Certificate From Let's Encrypt](/docs/step-cli/basic-crypto-operations#get-a-tls-certificate-from-lets-encrypt)
- [Generate JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) and JSON Web Keys (JWKs)](/docs/step-cli/basic-crypto-operations#generate-json-web-tokens-jwts-and-json-web-keys-jwks)
- [Obtain and Work With OAuth Tokens](/docs/step-cli/basic-crypto-operations#obtain-and-work-with-oauth-tokens)
- [Inspect an SSH certificate](/docs/step-cli/basic-crypto-operations#work-with-ssh-certificates)
- [Sign and encrypt arbitrary data using the NaCl library](/docs/step-cli/basic-crypto-operations#sign-and-encrypt-arbitrary-data)
- [Generate and verify TOTP tokens for multi-factor authentication (MFA)](/docs/step-cli/basic-crypto-operations#generate-totp-tokens-for-multi-factor-authentication-mfa)
