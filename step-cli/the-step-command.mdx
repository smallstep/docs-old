## Getting Help

`step` ships with extensive built-in help. To list available options and command groups, run `step` by itself. For help, use `step help <command>` or `step help <command> <subcommand>`.

## Environment variables

- `STEPPATH` The path where `step` stores its [configuration file](#configuration-file). This directory also holds `step-ca` state created with `step ca init`, including CA configuration, keys, certificates, and templates. Defaults to `$HOME/.step`.
- `STEPDEBUG` When set to `1`, `step` will provide extra diagnostic information for debugging. This variable can also be used with `step-ca`.
- `HTTPS_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` Configure proxies for outbound HTTPS traffic. See [net/http.ProxyFromEnvironment](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/#ProxyFromEnvironment) documentation for details. Note that the system trust store is _not_ trusted by `step` for the TLS handshake with the proxy server.
  - The proxy server will need to be configured to trust the CA.
  - Only `HTTPS_PROXY` is needed; `step`'s outbound connections are all HTTPS.
  - Add a `--root` or `STEP_ROOT` These files contain both the step CA certificate, and the proxy CA certificate will be trusted by step
Is this correct?

### Passing flags as environment variables

You can pass flags to `step` using environment variables, using `STEP_<flag>`. For example, `STEP_RAW=true step ssh list` is equivalent to `step ssh list --raw`. Command flags have precedence over environment variable flags, which in turn have precedence over the values in the [configuration file](#configuration-file).

## Configuration file

The file `$STEPPATH/config/defaults.json` can contain a JSON object listing default values for any flags accepted by `step` commands. It is typically used to store CA connection information, eg:

```json
{
  "ca-url": "https://ca.internal:8443",
  "fingerprint": "93cff06dc36251fb0c4985d0b5ed7265a368cd70697fba90355c93cc4aabff0d",
  "root": "/Users/carl/.step/certs/root_ca.crt",
  "redirect-url": ""
}
```

<Alert severity="info">
    It is not currently possible to segment default keys in <Code>defaults.json</Code> by subcommand. All keys are applied to all <Code>step</Code> commands.
