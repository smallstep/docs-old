This document defines and describes certificate authority core concepts that are integral to the design
and practical usage of `step-ca`.

## Online X.509 Certificate Authority

`step-ca` is an online certificate authority, meaning it runs as a server
on the network and accepts certificate requests.

## Provisioners

The certificate signing API exposed by `step-ca` requires mutual
authentication. The CA authenticates to the client using a certificate (which
the client verifies using the root certificate created during CA initialization). 
But the client must also authenticate to the CA. Again, this
presents a challenge: the client obviously can't use a certificate for
authentication because it doesn't have one yet.

To verify the legitimacy of certificate signing requests, we need some entity
that the CA trusts to measure and attest to the identity of our workloads. In
the _step certificates_ architecture this entity is called a _provisioner_,
because it helps to provision certificates.

In general, once a _provisioner_ authenticates a workload's identity it issues
the workload a _bearer token_ to submit to the CA, along with a [certificate
signing
request](https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki.html#certificate-signing-requests
'CSR') (CSR), to obtain a certificate. The _bearer token_ authenticates the
workload and authorizes the certificate request.

The details of how a provisioner interacts with a workload (or device or
person) and the CA vary by provisioner type. Smallstep supports a number of
provisioner types including:

- [ACME protocol](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#acme)
- [OAuth/OIDC Single Sign-on](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#oauthoidc-single-sign-on)
- [AWS Instance Identity Documents](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#aws)
- [Google Cloud Instance Identity Tokens](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#gcp)
- [Azure Instance Metadata Service](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#azure) 
- [Kubernetes Service Account Tokens](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#k8ssa-kubernetes-service-account) 
- [JWT for building custom integrations](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#jwt)

## Active vs. passive revocation

On the public internet, sometimes HTTPS certificates need to be revoked before
they expire. Over the years, there have been several methods for _actively
revoking_ HTTPS certificates. Any approach to solving this problem adds
complexity to the PKIâ€”usually in the form of additional network requests. For
example, a web browser might need to fetch a Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
from a URL embedded in an HTTPS certificate so it can make sure the
certificate, which would otherwise be valid, has not been actively revoked by
a trusted authority.

When designing a private PKI, you can make things a lot simpler and more
decentralized. If you make certificate lifetimes short enough, you can
_passively revoke_ a certificate by letting it expire and making sure the
Certificate Authority knows to reject any attempts to renew it.

## Other operational modes

`step-ca` has a couple of non-standard modes of operation.

### Registration Authority (RA) mode

`step-ca` can operate in Registration Authority (RA) mode.
An RA is a server that acts as an authentication layer for an upstream signing CA.

RA mode lets you separate certificate request authentication (the RA) from certificate signing operations (the CA).
This operational mode centralizes key management:
a single CA can serve several RAs.

In RA mode, `step-ca` can peer with two kinds of upstream CA: A `step-ca` instance, or a [Google CloudCAS](https://cloud.google.com/certificate-authority-service/) authority.

See the [Registration Authority (RA) Mode](configuration#registration-authority-ra-mode) section of our Configuration Guide for more on RA mode.

### Offline Mode

Sometimes it's useful to access a local CA offline, without running the `step-ca` server.
For this purpose, the `step` CLI can be used in _offline mode_ (with the `--offline` flag).
Offline mode uses the configuration, database, certificates, and keys of an existing `step-ca` installation.

This table shows some of the feature differences between an online `step-ca` server, `step` CLI in offline mode, and the [`step certificate` subcommand](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/basic-crypto-operations#run-an-offline-x509-certificate-authority).

### Example: Offline Mode

Let's create a certificate without `step-ca`:

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca init --name "Local CA" --provisioner admin --dns localhost --address ":443"
$ step ca certificate --offline foo.smallstep.com foo.crt foo.key
```
