### Before you begin

* You'll need a account on the smallstep platform. Need one? [**Register here**](https://smallstep.com/signup?product=ssh)
* You'll need the **enrollment token** you received upon signup.
* We support the following host platforms:
  * CentOS 8
  * CentOS 7
  * Amazon Linux 2
  * Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal)
  * Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic)
  * Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial)
  * Debian 10 (Buster)
  * Debian 9 (Stretch)
  * Debian 8 (Jessie)
* Running this quickstart will modify config files related to `systemd`, PAM, NSS, and SSHD:
  * We add `step-ssh-renew` and `step-ssh-metadata` services to `systemd`:
    * `step-ssh-renew` rotates the SSH host certificate every eight hours.
    * `step-ssh-metadata` syncs user ACLs with your CA every 3 seconds.
  * And we modify the following files:
    * `/etc/pam.d/sshd`
    * `/etc/pam.d/sudo`
    * `/etc/pam.d/su`
    * `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    * `/etc/nsswitch.conf`
  * We suggest backing these up before you begin setup on a particular base machine type, so that you can quickly revert changes if needed.

## Understanding Host Tags

**This section only applies to multi-user environments.**

**Host Tags** (key-value pairs) are the pillar of our access control model. 
Rather than mapping people or groups directly to hosts, you'll map _tag combinations_ to your hosts and to your user groups. o
First you'll put your hosts into logical groups using tags, eg. `role`:`web` or `env`:`staging`. 
Then, you'll grant user groups access to all hosts with a specific tag combination. 
Finally, you'll choose which user group tag combinations will allow `sudo` privileges on any matching hosts.

Let's look at an example:

![](/static/graphics/quickstart/host-tags-example.png)

* The `developers` group will have access to  `myserver #1` only.
* The `data` group will have access to  `myserver #2` and  `myserver #3`.
* The `ops` group will have `sudo` access to `myserver #2` and `myserver #3`.

Of course, hosts and groups can have as many tag combinations as you like.
Take a minute to think about how you'd like to use Host Tags in your environment.

## Quick Installation Instructions

Our installation script will guide you through host setup. It will:
* Install the `step` CLI and `step-ssh` utilities
* Comment out the broken `pam_systemd.so` in `common-session`,
which causes a delay at login
(this is a known Ubuntu/Debian bug)
* Bootstrap your host to your CA
* Enroll your host with an SSH host certificate
* Configure SSHD to use certificate authentication
* Activate `step-ssh` PAM/NSS modules
* Add the host to the CA's inventory

### Step 1. Install Smallstep SSH

#### If your host is a bastion host

As `root`, run:

```shell-session nocopy
$ curl -sSLO https://files.smallstep.com/ssh-host.sh
$ bash ssh-host.sh --is-bastion
```

#### If your host is _behind_ a bastion host

As `root`, run:

```shell-session nocopy
$ curl -sSLO https://files.smallstep.com/ssh-host.sh
$ bash ssh-host.sh --bastion=<bastion hostname>
```

#### For any other host

As `root`, run:

```shell
curl -sSf https://files.smallstep.com/ssh-host.sh | bash
```

You'll be prompted for
your team ID,
enrollment token,
hostname,
and a list of space-separated host tags
(eg. "`db=dev region=us-west-1`").

#### Passing flags to `ssh-host.sh`

The `ssh-host.sh` utility can also be run non-interactively,
as long as you provide the following _required flags_:
* `--team "[your team ID]"`
* `--token "[your enrollment token]"`
* `--hostname "[the hostname]"`
* One or more `--tag "key=value"` to assign [host tags](#understanding-host-tags)

The following additional flags are available:
* Any number of `--principal "[additional hostname]"`,
to add additional hostnames to the host certificate
* `--is-bastion` to indicate a bastion host
* `--bastion "[bastion hostname]"` to specify the bastion that sits in front of this host

### Step 2. Test your installation

Before you sign out of your `sudo` session, test your installation by logging in and running `sudo` in a separate session.

**This step is especially important if you have made any non-standard changes to your PAM or NSS stacks.**

Now sign in at `https://smallstep.com/app/[Team ID]`

You should see your host listed under the "**Hosts**" tab.

## Manual Instructions

If you wish to enroll your host without using our script,
you can follow our [step-by-step installation instructions](hosts-step-by-step) instead.

## Need to remove a host?

As `root` on the host, run:

```shell-session
curl -sSf https://files.smallstep.com/ssh-host-uninstall.sh | bash
```

This script will:
* Unregister the host from the host inventory on the CA
* Deactivate Smallstep SSH
* Revert SSHD configuration changes
* Remove your `$HOME/.step` configuration directory
* Remove the `step-ssh` package

## Optional Hardening

* Now that you're using certificates, you may wish to explicitly disallow the use of `authorized_keys` files on the host.

  You can do this by setting `AuthorizedKeysFile none` in `sshd_config`. You may want to allow `authorized_keys` for an emergency access account, however. A configuration for this might look like:

```
Match User *,!ubuntu
    AuthorizedKeysFile none
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

* Having trouble? You should be able to revert any changes by running `step-ssh deactivate`.
* Suspect host or user certificates are not working? In other words, your ssh client fails to log in or shows "trust on first use" warning? Try this:
  * Be sure you can connect to our test server, with `ssh-test.app.smallstep.com`.
  * On your client run `step ssh list` and find your user certificate marked `(ECDSA-CERT)`, e.g. `256 SHA256:Bb2TcimUYj8Nc5w4FhpZ/gmeNIIvLIzphTx35NzaRoA alice@smallstep.com (ECDSA-CERT)`, which you can inspect with `step ssh list --raw alice@smallstep.com | step ssh inspect`. Be sure the current time is neither before or after the period specified in `Valid:` .
  * On the destination host run `step ssh inspect /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key-cert.pub`. Make sure the current time is within the period of `Valid:`.
  * The destination host's `sshd_config` should show included the following lines for `sshd` (make sure the service has reloaded its config) to leverage certificate-based authentication:

  ```shell-session nocopy
  $ tail -n 7 /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  #       ForceCommand cvs server

  # autogenerated by step @ 2020-04-02T21:16:05Z
  TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub
  HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key-cert.pub
  HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
  # end
  ```

  * You can run `sshd -t` (as root) to test you SSHD configuration. No output means the file is OK; you'll get an error if any of the referenced files (eg. host keys) are not accessible to `sshd`.
* Suspect your ssh client might have a problem? Use verbose logging `ssh -v <hostname>`. Look out for following key lines/events below in your log. If you don't see errors the absence of these events might indicate your config is invalid / not being applied.
  * Your team's config is applied for this specific host:

    ```
    debug1: Executing command: 'step ssh check-host ec2-52-200-74-193.compute-1.amazonaws.com'
    debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
    debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 48: Applying options for *

    debug1: Executing proxy command: exec step ssh proxycommand --provisioner "okta" alice ec2-52-200-74-193.compute-1.amazonaws.com 22
    ```
  * The host certificate passed authentication on the client:

    ```
    debug1: Server host certificate: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256-cert-v01@openssh.com SHA256:ON/csaCQ4yDKfxblQnOLTiZIOoOtsHPAjQn6DrW+k9I, serial 2468062085372141930 ID "ec2-52-200-74-193.compute-1.ama

    debug1: Found CA key in /Users/alice/.step/ssh/known_hosts:1
    ```
  * The username being used for authentication:

    ```
    debug1: Authenticating to ec2-52-200-74-193.compute-1.amazonaws.com:22 as 'alice'
    ```

  * The ssh client offers the user's certificate to the destination host:

    ```
    debug1: Offering public key: sebastian@smallstep.com ECDSA-CERT SHA256:VIa1uWhBTjjtpW3IBkUG/aFGfqlUhjkXNQVk6Hc1lXc agent
    debug1: Server accepts key: alice@smallstep.com ECDSA-CERT SHA256:VIa1uWhBTjjtpW3IBkUG/aFGfqlUhjkXNQVk6Hc1lXc agent
    debug1: sign_and_send_pubkey: no separate private key for certificate "alice@smallstep.com"
    ```
