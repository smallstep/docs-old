### How to sync UIDs and GIDs from Okta

Smallstep can automatically sync POSIX user and group IDs for your users from your identity provider.

To set up UID and GID syncing, we're going to need our SCIM app to map those attributes from your Okta user profiles.

This feature does not sync POSIX group membership mappings. Only UID and GID values are synced.

### Step 1. Add UID and GID fields to your Okta user profile

Already have UID and GID fields for your users? Skip to Step 2.

* Start at your Okta admin panel
* Go to **Directory â†’ Profile Editor**
* The first listed profile should be the **Okta User** profile. Choose **ðŸ–‹  Profile** here.
* Choose **+ Add Attribute** and add a uid attribute with data type **"number"**.

  You may want to provide an Attribute Range minimum here, especially if you want to protect a range of IDs for service accounts on your hosts.

* **Save and Add Another**, then create a GID attribute with data type **"number"**.

* **Save**

### Step 2. Add UID and GID fields to your Smallstep SCIM profile

* Go to **Directory â†’ Profile Editor**
* Find your **smallstep-scim** profile. Choose **ðŸ–‹  Profile** here.
* Choose **+Add Attribute** and add a uid attribute.
  Data type **number**
  External namespace  `urn:scim:smallstep:ssh:schema`
  Scope â˜‘ **User personal**
  The attribute should be marked **required**, because any Okta user with an empty uid or gid value won't sync to Smallstep.

* **Save and Add Another,** and add a gid attribute.

* **Save**

### Step 3. Add mappings from Okta to your Smallstep SCIM app

* Go to **Applications â†’ Applications**
* Choose your **smallstep-scim** application
* Go to the **Provisioning** tab
* Under **smallstep-scim Attribute Mappings**, you should see that uid and gid are not mapped.
* Edit the mapping for `uid`:

  Map from **Okta Profile  `uid`  field**.

  Apply on **Create and update**

* **Save**, and 
* **Repeat** for `gid`.
* When you're finished, the mappings should look like this:

### Step 4. Verify syncing with smallstep before going into production
