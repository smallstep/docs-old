description: Learn how to secure comms across autonomous internal PKI, perform easy PKI migrations, and automate online root rotations using PKI trust models and step-ca

Suppose `foo.internal` is running in AWS, and `bar.internal` is running in GCP.
To communicate, requests must be sent across the public internet. Traditionally
this sort of cross-connectivity is secured using a network-level tunnel, like
an SSH tunnel or a VPN. These tunnels are often configured and managed ad-hoc.

They can also be challenging to scale and operate and introduce a single point
of failure into an otherwise resilient system. With a PKI trust model and
automated certificate management, you can leverage mTLS for secure
cross-connectivity without a VPN to avoid these issues.

In this scenario, you may want to run two CAs: one in AWS and one in GCP. That
way, you don’t need to expose `step-ca` to the public internet. To make this
work, these CAs must federate a PKI trust model, which means `foo.internal` and
`bar.internal` must trust both CAs to issue certificates.

The `step ca federation` subcommand can be used to distribute the bundle of
federated roots to workloads in both clouds.

## Requirements

- This tutorial assumes you have initialized and started up a `step-ca` instance using the steps in [Getting Started](/docs/step-ca/getting-started). As an alternative, you can use our hosted CA, [Smallstep Certificate Manager](/certificate-manager)

## Overview

The basic federation tutorial below showcases how to securely facilitate communication between relying parties of multiple autonomous certificate authorities.

This tutorial uses a pre-generated PKI. Do not use these pre-generated PKIs for **any** purposes outside of this tutorial.

You can find all of the code in this tutorial here:<br/>

This is what we will cover in this tutorial:

- [Launching the federated online CAs](#launching-the-federated-online-cas)
- [Bringing up a demo server](#bringing-up-the-demo-server)
- [Running the demo client](#running-the-demo-client)
- [Curl as a client](#curl-as-a-client)



## Launching the federated online CAs

If you want to follow along with the example code, clone the repository and go to the `basic-federation` folder.

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="git clone https://github.com/smallstep/certificates.git && cd ./certificates/examples/basic-federation">
{`$ git clone https://github.com/smallstep/certificates.git
Cloning into 'certificates'...

$ cd ./certificates/examples/basic-federation`}</CodeBlock>

Open two terminals to use as online CAs and call them `Cloud CA` and `Kubernetes CA`. The password for both of these online CAs is `password`.

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="step-ca ./pki/cloud/config/ca.federated.json">
{`$ step-ca ./pki/cloud/config/ca.federated.json
Please enter the password to decrypt intermediate_ca_key: password
2019/01/22 13:38:52 Serving HTTPS on :1443 ...`}</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="step-ca ./pki/kubernetes/config/ca.federated.json">
{`$ step-ca ./pki/kubernetes/config/ca.federated.json
Please enter the password to decrypt intermediate_ca_key: password
2019/01/22 13:39:44 Serving HTTPS on :2443 ...`}</CodeBlock>

Notice the difference between the two configuration options below. `Cloud CA` will list `Kubernetes CA` in the `federatedRoots` section and vice versa.

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="diff pki/cloud/config/ca.json pki/cloud/config/ca.federated.json">
{`$ diff pki/cloud/config/ca.json pki/cloud/config/ca.federated.json
3c3
<    "federatedRoots": [],
---
>    "federatedRoots": ["pki/cloud/certs/kubernetes_root_ca.crt"],
`}</CodeBlock>

## Bringing up the demo server

Once both online CAs are up and running, let's bring up the demo server, using
a certificate from the `Cloud CA`. This demo server leverages [step's
SDK](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/smallstep/certificates/ca) to obtain X.509
certificates, automatically renew them, and fetch a trusted roots bundle. When
it starts, it will report what root certificates it will use to authenticate
client certificates.

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="go run server/main.go $(step ca token --ca-url https://localhost:1443 --root ./pki/cloud/certs/root_ca.crt 127.0.0.1)">
{`$ go run server/main.go $(step ca token --ca-url https://localhost:1443 --root ./pki/cloud/certs/root_ca.crt 127.0.0.1)
✔ Key ID: EE1ZiqkMaxsUdpz8SCSkRBzwK9TWUoidQnMnJ8Eryn8 (sebastian@smallstep.com)
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key: password
Server is using federated root certificates
Accepting certs anchored in CN=Smallstep Public Cloud Root CA
Accepting certs anchored in CN=Smallstep Kubernetes Root CA
Listening on :8443 ...`}</CodeBlock>

## Running the demo client

Similarly, step's SDK provides a client option to mutually authenticate connections to servers. It automatically handles certificate bootstrapping, renewal, and fetches a bundle of trusted roots. The demo client will send HTTP requests to the demo server periodically or about every 5s. This client is going to use a certificate from the `Kubernetes CA`.

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="go run client/main.go $(step ca token sdk_client --ca-url https://localhost:2443 --root ./pki/kubernetes/certs/root_ca.crt)">
{`$ go run client/main.go $(step ca token sdk_client --ca-url https://localhost:2443 --root ./pki/kubernetes/certs/root_ca.crt)
✔ Key ID: S5gYgpeqcIAgc1Zr4myZXpgJ_Ao4ryS6F6wqg9o8RYo (sebastian@smallstep.com)
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key: password
Server responded: Hello sdk_client (cert issued by 'Smallstep Kubernetes Root CA') at 2019-01-23 00:51:38.576648 +0000 UTC`}</CodeBlock>

## Curl as a client

While the demo client provides a convenient way to periodically send requests to the demo server, curl in combination with a client certificate from `Kubernetes CA` can hit the server instead:

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="step ca certificate kube_client kube_client.crt kube_client.key --ca-url https://localhost:2443 --root pki/kubernetes/certs/root_ca.crt">
{`$ step ca certificate kube_client kube_client.crt kube_client.key --ca-url https://localhost:2443 --root pki/kubernetes/certs/root_ca.crt
✔ Key ID: S5gYgpeqcIAgc1Zr4myZXpgJ_Ao4ryS6F6wqg9o8RYo (sebastian@smallstep.com)
✔ Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key:
✔ CA: https://localhost:2443/1.0/sign
✔ Certificate: kube_client.crt
✔ Private Key: kube_client.key`}</CodeBlock>

Federation relies on a bundle of multiple trusted roots which need to be fetched before being passed into curl.

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="step ca federation --ca-url https://localhost:1443 --root pki/cloud/certs/root_ca.crt federated.pem">
{`$ step ca federation --ca-url https://localhost:1443 --root pki/cloud/certs/root_ca.crt federated.pem
The federation certificate bundle has been saved in federated.pem.`}</CodeBlock>

Then you have to pass the certificate issued by Kubernetes CA into curl using the appropriate command line flags:

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="curl -i --cacert federated.pem --cert kube_client.crt --key kube_client.key https://127.0.0.1:8443">
{`$ curl -i --cacert federated.pem --cert kube_client.crt --key kube_client.key https://127.0.0.1:8443
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 28 Jan 2019 15:24:54 GMT
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 105\n
Hello kube_client (cert issued by 'Smallstep Kubernetes Root CA') at 2019-01-28 15:24:54.864373 +0000 UTC`}</CodeBlock>

Since the demo server is enrolled with the federated `Cloud CA` that trusts
X.509 certificates issued by the `Kubernetes CA` through federation, the connection
is successfully established.
