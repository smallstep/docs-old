`step-ca` is an online Certificate Authority (CA) for secure, automated X.509 and SSH certificate management. People use our tooling to automate issuance, renewal, and revocation of certificates for all types of workloads and use cases. This tutorial section highlights many popular deployment scenarios and is designed to help the participant learn by doing. Each activity includes detailed examples and copy/paste code blocks. 

In general, these tutorials assume you have initialized and started up a `step-ca` instance using the steps in [Getting Started](/docs/step-ca/getting-started). As an alternative, you can use our hosted CA, [Smallstep Certificate Manager](/certificate-manager).
