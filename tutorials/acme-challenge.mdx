description: Combine ACME challenges with any ACME client to automatically issue internal X.509 certificates. Learn how to use open source step-CA as a private ACME server.
---


ACME support in `step-ca` allows software to leverage [existing ACME clients
and libraries][le-client-opts] to get X.509 certificates from your own certificate
authority (CA) using an ACME challenge. ACME is a standardized protocol. It
describes a mechanism for automatic validation and issuance of X.509 certificates
from a certificate authority to clients.

## Requirements

- **Open source -** This tutorial assumes you have initialized and started up a `step-ca`instance using the steps in [Getting Started](/docs/step-ca/getting-started).
- **[Smallstep Certificate Manager](/certificate-manager) -** use [this documentation](/docs/certificate-manager/acme) instead of this tutorial.

* [Examples](#examples)

## Why ACME?

There are many reasons you might want to run your own ACME CA.

For example, you can:

- Use ACME in production to issue X.509 certificates to internal workloads, proxies,
  queues, databases, etc. so you can use mutual TLS for authentication and
  encryption.
- Simulate Let’s Encrypt’s certificate authority in development and
  pre-production scenarios where connecting to [Let’s Encrypt’s staging
  server][le-staging] is problematic.

## Rundown

At a high level, ACME is pretty simple.  An ACME client creates an account with
an ACME server and submits a certificate order.  The server responds with a set
of challenges for the client to complete in order to prove it has control over
domain names, or _identifiers_, in the certificate.  Once the client
successfully completes the ACME challenge, it submits a certificate signing
request (CSR) and the server issues a certificate.

There is not a single standard way to prove control over an identifier, so the
core ACME specification makes this an extension point.  There are three
challenge types broadly used in practice, all of which are supported by
`step-ca`.

## ACME Challenges

### The HTTP Challenge (http-01)

The ACME server challenges the client to host a random number at a random URL on the domain in question and verifies client control by issuing an HTTP GET request to that URL.

**Use Case**

A service that commonly uses this approach is Google Analytics.

### The DNS Challenge (dns-01)

The ACME server challenges the client to provision a random DNS `TXT` record for the domain in question and verifies client control by querying DNS for that `TXT` record.

**Use Case**

You might see a challenge like this when trying to use third-party tools, like plugins or some Amazon cloud services.

### The TLS alpn challenge (tls-alpn-01)

The ACME server uses application layer protocol negotiation to request an ACME challenge validation.
The client then presents a self-signed TLS certificate containing the identifier in question as a special x509 extension.

**Use Case**

The TLS ALPN challenge is commonly used in cases where an ingress controller fronts clients attempting to receive a certificate, or in cases where, for any number of reasons, TLS is the only allowed external protocol.

## ACME with open source `step-ca`

Now, let's demonstrate provisioning a X.509 certificate with ACME using `step-ca`.

[Add an ACME provisioner](/docs/step-ca/provisioners#acme) to your `step-ca` configuration to enable ACME:

```shell
step ca provisioner add acme --type ACME
```

Restart `step-ca` to pick up the configuration changes.

## Configuring Clients

To configure an ACME client to connect to `step-ca` you need to do two things:

1. point the client to the right [ACME directory URL][acme-dir-url], and
2. tell the client to trust your CA’s root certificate.

[acme-dir-url]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555#section-7.1.1

### Pointing clients to the right ACME Directory URL

Most ACME clients connect to Let’s Encrypt’s CA by default.
To connect to `step-ca`, you need to point the client to the right ACME Directory URL.

A single instance of `step-ca` can have multiple ACME provisioners, each with its own ACME Directory URL.
The ACME directory URL has the form:

```
https://{ca-host}/acme/{provisioner-name}/directory
```

We just added an ACME provisioner named `acme` in step 2. Its ACME directory URL is:

```
https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory
```

### Telling Clients to Trust Your CA’s Root Certificate

Clients will validate the server’s HTTPS certificate using the public root certificates in your system’s default trust store.
When you’re connecting to Let’s Encrypt, it’s a public certificate authority and its root certificate is already in your system’s default trust store.
Your internal root certificate isn’t, so HTTPS connections from ACME clients to `step-ca` will fail.

There are two ways to address this challenge.
Either:

- explicitly configure your ACME client to trust step-ca’s root certificate, or
- add the `step-ca` root certificate to your system’s default trust store.

`step-cli` provides a helper command to do the latter:

```shell
step certificate install
```

If you are using your certificate authority for TLS in production, explicitly configuring your ACME client to only trust your root certificate is a better option.
You will see how this method works with an example below.
You can find several other examples [here](/docs/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients).

If you are simulating Let’s Encrypt in pre-production, installing your root certificate is a more realistic simulation of production.
Once your root certificate is installed, no additional client configuration is necessary.

<Alert severity="warning">
  <AlertTitle>A Word of Caution</AlertTitle>
  Adding a root certificate to your system’s trust store is a global operation. Certificates issued by your CA will be trusted everywhere, including in web browsers.

## Examples

`step-ca` should work with any ACMEv2 (RFC8555) compliant client that supports the http-01 or dns-01 challenge.
We created a [seperate tutorial](/tutorials/acme-protocol-acme-clients) that documents the most popular ACME client configurations.

**Certbot**

[certbot][] is the most commonly used ACME client.
Built and supported by the EFF, it’s the standard-bearer for production-grade command-line ACME.

[certbot]: https://certbot.eff.org/

To get a certificate from `step-ca` using certbot you need to:

- tell certbot to trust your root certificate using the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable
- point certbot at your ACME directory URL using the `--server` flag

For example:

```shell
sudo REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \
	certbot certonly -n --standalone -d foo.internal \
	--server https://ca.internal/acme/acme/directory
```

`sudo` is required in certbot’s [standalone mode](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#standalone) so it can listen on port 80 to complete the http-01 challenge.
If you already have a webserver running, you can use [webroot mode](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#webroot) instead.

With the [appropriate plugin](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#dns-plugins), certbot also supports the dns-01 challenge for most popular DNS providers.
Deeper integrations with nginx and Apache can even configure your server to use HTTPS automatically and you can do this with `step-ca`.

You can renew all of the certificates you have installed using cerbot by running:

```shell-session
$ sudo REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt certbot renew
```

You can automate renewal with a simple cron entry:

```
*/15 * * * * root REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE=$(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt certbot -q renew
```

The certbot packages for some Linux distributions will create a cron entry or [systemd timer][systemd-timer] like this for you.
This entry won’t work with `step-ca` because it doesn’t set the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable.
You need to manually update it.

[systemd-timer]: https://stevenwestmoreland.com/2017/11/renewing-certbot-certificates-using-a-systemd-timer.html

By default, `step-ca` issues certificates with 24 hour lifetimes.
Certbot’s default renewal job is tuned for Let’s Encrypt’s 90 day certificate lifetimes.
It is run every 12 hours with actual renewals occurring for certificates within 30 days of expiration.

The cron entry above accounts for this by running certbot renew every 15 minutes.
You will also want to configure your domain to only renew certificates when they are within a few hours of expiration by adding a line like the following to the top of your renewal configuration file, like in `/etc/letsencrypt/renewal/foo.internal.conf`.

```ini
renew_before_expiry = 8 hours
```
