title: Configure step-ca with an RSA certificate chain
html_title: Create a root and intermediate CA chain that uses RSA keys
---

## Requirements

This tutorial assumes you have installed the `step` and `step-ca` software,
and that you've just initialized a CA using the steps in [Getting Started](/docs/step-ca/getting-started).

## Instructions

Some legacy applications require a certificate chain that uses RSA keys, but  `step ca init` creates a PKI that uses ECDSA keys by default. In this tutorial, you will replace the default ECDSA chain with an RSA chain.

First, stop your `step-ca` server if it is running.

Next, delete your existing PKI and create RSA root and intermediate certificates and keys.
**This step will overwrite your existing CA.**

```bash
step certificate create "Example Root CA" \
	$(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \
	$(step path)/secrets/root_ca_key \
	--profile root-ca \
	--kty RSA
step certificate create "Example Intermediate CA" \
	$(step path)/certs/intermediate_ca.crt \
	$(step path)/secrets/intermediate_ca_key \
	--profile intermediate-ca \
	--ca $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt \
	--ca-key $(step path)/secrets/root_ca_key \
	--kty RSA
```

Change the certificate subject names as desired.
You'll be prompted to supply a password to encrypt your private keys.

You can now restart `step-ca` server.
