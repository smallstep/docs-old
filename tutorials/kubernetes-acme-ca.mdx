## About this tutorial

In this example, we'll configure Kubernetes [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to get a certificate from an internal ACME server,
using cert-manager's [ACME issuer](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/).

- Estimated effort: Reading time ~4 mins, Lab time ~20 to 60 mins.

## Requirements

- You have initialized and started up a `step-ca` ACME instance using the steps in [our ACME server tutorial](/docs/tutorials/acme-challenge).
  Alternatively, you can use our hosted CA, [Smallstep Certificate Manager](/certificate-manager).
- You'll need the root certificate PEM file for your CA.

### 0. Before you begin

This example uses the ACME `dns-01` challenge type, with [Google Cloud DNS](https://console.cloud.google.com/net-services/dns/).
We'll create a service account on Google Cloud that cert-manager will use to solve DNS challenges.
For other DNS providers, or other ACME challenge types, you'll need to change the challenge solver settings below.

### 1. Create a Kubernetes cluster

For this tutorial, I created a Google Compute Engine VM running a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster.
I'm using kind for testing, but pretty much any Kubernetes cluster will do.

```bash
$ kind cluster create
```

### 2. Set up cert-manager to trust your internal CA

Let's install [Kubernetes cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) and patch it so that it will trust your internal ACME CA.

First, install cert-manager:

```bash
$ kubectl apply --validate=false -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.0.4/cert-manager.yaml
```

Next, create a `ConfigMap` that contains your ACME server's CA certificate.
To find your certificate's PEM file, select your CA in the [Google Cloud CAS Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/security/cas/manage), and view your CA certificate under the Actions menu.

Create a file called `internal-ca.yaml`, replacing the certificate shown here with your own:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  internal-ca.pem: |
    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    [REPLACE with your CA certificate]
    -----END CERTIFICATE-----
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: ca-pemstore
  namespace: cert-manager
  resourceVersion: "9978"
  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/cert-manager/configmaps/ca-pemstore
---
```

Apply it:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f internal-ca.yaml
```

To inject this `ConfigMap` into cert-manager, we need to patch the `cert-manager` Deployment to add the CA certificate as a container volume mount.

Create a file called `cm-ca-patch.yaml`:

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - --v=2
        - --cluster-resource-namespace=$(POD_NAMESPACE)
        - --leader-election-namespace=kube-system
        name: cert-manager
        volumeMounts:
        - name: ca-pemstore
          mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs/internal-ca.pem
          subPath: internal-ca.pem
          readOnly: false
        resources: {}
      volumes:
        - name: ca-pemstore
          configMap:
            # Provide the name of the ConfigMap containing the files you want
            # to add to the container
            name: ca-pemstore
```

Apply the patch:

```bash
$ kubectl patch deployment cert-manager -n cert-manager --patch "$(cat cm-ca-patch.yaml)"
```

Cert-manager is now configured to trust your ACME CA.

### 3. Create a GCP service account and import its credentials

> **Not using Google Cloud Platform?** You can skip this step and configure the cert-manager `Issuer` in step 4 to use a different challenge solver.
  See cert-manager's documentation for [`http-01`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/http01/) and [`dns-01`](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/) solvers.

We're going to have cert-manager solve `dns-01` ACME challenges.
So, it will need to be able to manage DNS entries.

Let's create a Google Cloud Platform service account with the `roles/dns.admin` role. Replace the `PROJECT_ID` here with your own:

```bash
$ export PROJECT_ID=step-cas-test
$ gcloud iam service-accounts create dns01-solver \
   --project $PROJECT_ID --display-name "dns01-solver"
$ gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
   --member serviceAccount:dns01-solver@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
   --role roles/dns.admin
```

Now import the service account's credentials as a Kubernetes secret:

```bash
$ gcloud iam service-accounts keys create key.json \
   --iam-account dns01-solver@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
$ kubectl create secret generic clouddns-dns01-solver-svc-acct \
   --from-file=key.json
```

### 4. Create the cert-manager Issuer

Finally, let's create an cert-manager Issuer to perform `dns-01` ACME challenges. Make a new file called `acme-issuer.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: acme-issuer
spec:
  acme:
    email: carl@smallstep.com
    server: https://ca.smallstep.internal/acme/acme/directory
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: acme-issuer-account-key
    solvers:
    - dns01:
        cloudDNS:
          # Your Google Cloud Platform project ID:
          project: step-cas-test
          # Your Google CloudDNS zone name we will use for DNS01 challenges:
          hostedZoneName: step-cas-internal
          serviceAccountSecretRef:
            name: clouddns-dns01-solver-svc-acct
            key: key.json
```

Replace the values for `email`, `server` URL, `project` and `hostedZoneName` with your own. Your Smallstep ACME endpoint will always take the form of `https://[your CA hostname]/acme/acme/directory`.

Apply it:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f acme-issuer.yaml
```

You now have an automated ACME certificate manager running inside your Kubernetes cluster.

### 5. Issue a test certificate

Let's get a test certificate from our ACME CA, using a Certificate object. Create a file called `tls-certificate.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: k8s-internal
  namespace: default
spec:
  secretName: k8s-internal-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: acme-issuer
  dnsNames:
  - k8s.smallstep.internal
```

Replace the `dnsNames` value with a DNS name that's inside your zone.

Apply it:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f tls-certificate.yaml
```

You can check the status with `kubectl get certificaterequest` or `kubectl describe certificate`:

```bash
$ kubectl get certificaterequest
NAME                    READY   AGE
k8s-internal-nzbnm      True    7s
$ kubectl describe certificate k8s-internal
Name:         k8s-internal
Namespace:    default
...
Kind:         Certificate
Metadata:
  Creation Timestamp:  2020-11-03T23:06:46Z
...
Spec:
  Dns Names:
    k8s.smallstep.internal
  Issuer Ref:
    Name:       acme-issuer
  Secret Name:  k8s-internal-tls
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2020-11-03T23:11:01Z
    Message:               Certificate is up to date and has not expired
    Reason:                Ready
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Ready
  Not After:               2020-11-04T23:11:01Z
  Not Before:              2020-11-03T23:11:01Z
  Renewal Time:            2020-11-04T15:11:01Z
  Revision:                1
Events:
  Type    Reason     Age    From          Message
  ----    ------     ----   ----          -------
  Normal  Issuing    10m    cert-manager  Issuing certificate as Secret does not exist
  Normal  Generated  10m    cert-manager  Stored new private key in temporary Secret resource "k8s-internal-g79jq"
  Normal  Requested  10m    cert-manager  Created new CertificateRequest resource "k8s-internal-nzbnm"
  Normal  Issuing    9m33s  cert-manager  The certificate has been successfully issued
```

As you can see, cert-manager will automatically renew the certificate when approximately 2/3 of its lifetime has elapsed.

That's it! You now have automated, short-lived certificates for your Kubernetes cluster. There are [many use cases](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/) for X.509 certificates issued through cert-manager.
