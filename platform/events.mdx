Events power alerting for certificate lifecycle activities. 
Used to help administrators operate the Smallstep Platform, 
Events can be generated and surfaced via standard mechanisms. 
You can use Events to:

- **Alert on certificate expiry** - Prevent certificate expiry related outages with proactive notifications on upcoming expirations.
- **Stream events to monitoring solutions** - Push detailed certificate information to third-party monitoring and alerting systems.
- **Monitor certificate operations** - Ensure your automated certificate toolchain is operating as expected.
