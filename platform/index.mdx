- **[Provisioners](/docs/platform/provisioners)**— Machinery for securely automating certificate issuance
- **[Inventories](/docs/platform/inventories)**— Catalogs of entities like hosts, services, and people for use with templates and provisioners
- **[Templates](/docs/platform/templates)**— Customization of x.509 or SSH certificates for any use case
- **[Events](/docs/platform/events)**— Observability and alerting for certificate lifecycle activities
