Smallstep Certificate Manager is a commercial product that delivers a managed certificate authority (CA) capable of issuing private x.509 TLS or SSH certificates. 
Certificate Manager builds on two open source projects, maintained by smallstep:
* `step-ca`: a private online certificate authority for secure automated certificate management.
* `step`: a general-purpose cryptography toolkit and the client-side counterpart to step-ca.
With Certificate Manager, you can create your own private CA to manage certificates on internal services, websites, infrastructure, people, or devices. 

Before you begin.
1. [register for a smallstep account](https://smallstep.com/signup?product=cm) if you haven't already.
2. [Install `step`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation), which will be used to manage access to, and get certificates from, an authority.  

### step 1 - create an Authority
Certificate Manager authorities are trusted services that manage certificate issuance and revocation.
In this tutorial, we will create a hosted authority, an online CA that authenticates and authorizes certificate requests and issues certificates.
 
* Log into the smallstep dashboard, select the Certificate Manager tab, and click the create authority button.
* Select a new hosted authority.
* Provide an authority Name used in the smallstep dashboard to identify the CA for reporting purposes.
* Enter a subdomain value indicating the URL path you wish for your online CA to be available.
* Click the create button

Behind the scenes, Certificate Manager will create a new root and an online intermediate CA, placing the private keys into Google's [Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management).
On the Authority detail page, you will see the CA URL and Fingerprint;
These values will be used to interact with your CA.
Certificate Manager also created a default provisioner called 'authority-admin' and an authority super admin with your email address as the subject. 
These default values will be used to issue your first certificate. 

### step 2 - configure your client
Certificate Manager authorities are administered using the `step` command-line client. 
To connect your local client with the hosted authority, you need to bootstrap into the PKI. 
Run the following command substituting the CA-specific values with your hosted authorities properties. 
You can also copy/paste this command by visiting the authority detail > Quick Actions section in the smallstep dashboard.

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca bootstrap --ca-url [YOUR CA URL] --fingerprint [YOUR AUTHORITY FINGERPRINT]">
  {`$ step ca bootstrap --ca-url [YOUR CA URL] --fingerprint [YOUR AUTHORITY FINGERPRINT]`}
</CodeBlock>

This command will download the CA Root certificate and configure your local client to interact with the Authority.

### step 3 - Create a certificate
With an authority created and your local client configured, you can create a certificate by running the `step ca certificate` command.
Here is an example:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca certificate myservice myservice.crt myservice.key --san myservice.internal.mycompany.net --not-after 24h">
  {`$ step ca certificate myservice myservice.crt myservice.key --san myservice.internal.mycompany.net --not-after 24h`}
</CodeBlock>

In this command, we are asking the CA to create a certificate with the following properties
* `myservice` - The name on the certificate
* `myservice.crt` - Store the certificate in a file with this name
* `myservice.key` - Store the key in a file with this name
* `--san myservice.internal.mycompany.net` - Add an additional SAN to the certificate with the specified value
* `--not-after 24h` - Set the certificate to expire after 24 hours.

When you execute this command, it will envoke the 'authority-admin' OIDC provisioner and push you through a single sign-on flow via the smallstep dashboard.
Upon successful completion and verification, the authority will issue the certificate. 
You can inspect your certificate by running the following command.

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step certificate inspect --short myservice.crt">
  {`$ step certificate inspect --short myservice.crt`}
</CodeBlock>

It should look similar to this.

```shell
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2441...2018]
  Subject:     98496ed4-7f27-4367-b7a2-ef828e0a4eda
               admin@yourco.com
               https://auth.smallstep.com#98496ed4-7f27-4367-b7a2-ef828e0a4eda
  Issuer:      provisioner test Intermediate CA
  Provisioner: authority-admin [ID: 909d...8521]
  Valid from:  2021-10-04T21:30:12Z
          to:  2021-10-05T21:31:12Z
```

### step 4 - renew a certificate
Certificates expire. 
Certificate Manager makes renewing a certificate ahead of expiration easy. 
Renewals are authenticated using your existing certificate and produce an identical certificate with a new serial number and extended lifetime.

In its most primitive form, renewal is a simple single-command operation:

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca renew svc.crt svc.key">
  {`$ step ca renew svc.crt svc.key`}
</CodeBlock>

More than a dozen command-line flags make [`step ca renew`](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/reference/ca/renew) flexible and easy to integrate into almost any operational environment.

That's it. 
You've now created an authority, issued a certificate, and renewed a certificate which is the foundation of your certificate management experience. 

## Next Steps
Some common next steps include.
*  Remove the human interactions and [automate certificate renewal](/docs/step-ca/certificate-authority-server-production#automated-renewal).
*  Start using a password, one-time token, cloud VM API, or other mechanism to [operationalize getting certificates](/docs/certificate-manager/how-it-works#provisioners).
*  Modify and automate custom certificate attributues using [certificate templates](/docs/step-ca/templates).
*  Create your own [private ACME server](/docs/certificate-manager/acme).
*  Talk with the [smallstep technical team](https://smallstep.com/request-demo).
